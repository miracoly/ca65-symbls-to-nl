== Usage
1. Build the tool like described in <<_build_install>>.
2. Build your NES assembly files with `-g` flag, which adds https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html#ss2.1[debug info].
+
[source,sh]
----
ca65 -g main.s -o main.o
----
3. Tell you linker to generate symbol file with `-Ln`. This generates `main.nes` as well as `main.nes.0` which contains the symbols. Fceux can not understand this file.
+
[source,sh]
----
ld65 -Ln main.nes.0 main.o -o main.nes
----
4. Convert the file to a *.nl file.
+
[source,sh]
----
ca65-symbls-to-nl -f main.nes.0
----
This conversion looks like this:

5. Open your `.nes` file as usually. Fceux will automatically find the symbols file and show it accordingly, as long as your `.nes` and `.nes.0.nl` have the same base name.
